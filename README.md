# Sunflower and Tulip Classifier
This Python Colab notebook downloads photos of sunflowers and tulips from Bing and separates them into training and validation sets. The notebook then uses a convolutional neural network to train a model to determine whether a photo is of a sunflower or a tulip.

# How to Use
1. Open the Colab notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the first cell to make directories for each one of them.
3. Run the second cell to install the necessary packages.
4. Run the third cell to download the photos from Bing.
5. Run the forth cell to make training and validation directories.
6. Run the fifth cell to separate the photos into training and validation sets.
7. Run the sixth cell to install necessary packages.
8. Run the 7th and 8th cells to train the model.
9. Run the 9th cell to test the accuracy of the model.
10. Finally, run the last cell to use the model to classify new photos of sunflowers and tulips.
# Project Structure
The notebook consists of the following sections:

- Data Collection: This section contains code to download photos from Bing and store them in the notebook.
- Data Preparation: This section contains code to separate the downloaded photos into training and validation sets.
- Model Training: This section contains code to train a convolutional neural network on the training set.
- Model Evaluation: This section contains code to evaluate the accuracy of the trained model on the validation set.
 -Model Deployment: This section contains code to use the trained model to classify new photos of sunflowers and tulips.
